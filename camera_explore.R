# II. Basic analysis

nrow(auctions) 

# 2) number of bidders: 18773, number of sellers: 1199
length(unique(camera_named$bidder))
length(unique(camera_named$seller))

# 3) average number of bidders per trade: 9.46
camera_named %>%  
  group_by(item_id) %>% 
  summarize(n = n_distinct(bidder, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  summarize(mean = mean(n))

# The average number of bidders is substantially higher than (number of bidders) / (number of trades) 18773 / 4388 = 4.278259
# This means some of the bidders are very active

# 4) how active are the bidders
camera_named %>%  # the most active bidder bids 154 times

  ggplot(aes(x = bid_time_relative)) +
  geom_freqpoly()

# 6) transaction price (highest price) distribution: 
#           for cameras, the prices are more diverse than expected, especially for the lower ranges
#           also, the distribution of the highest bids is very close to the distribution of the buy it now prices

# III. Analysis for the buy-it-now mechanism

# NOTE: for the explanation of the buy-it-now mechanism, please refer to buy_it_now_mechanism.txt

# 1) there are many cases where the bid_price is higher than the buy_it_now price
ggplot(camera_named, aes(x = buy_it_now, y = bid_price, colour = (bid_price > buy_it_now))) + 
  geom_point(alpha = 0.8, size = 0.5, show.legend = FALSE)

# 2) some of the products have multiple bidders bidding the buy_it_now price
camera_named %>%  
  filter(bid_price == buy_it_now) %>% 
  count(item_id) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n))

# 3) surprisingly, even if the first bid equals to the buy-it-now price, many trades don't just end there. 194 cases
trades %>% 
  filter(first_bid == buy_it_now) %>% 
  filter(n_bids > 1)

# 4) even more surprisingly, some bidders bid higher than buy-it-now price in their first bid. 40 cases
#    They would obviously be better off by just bidding the buy-it-now price 
trades %>% 
  filter(first_bid > buy_it_now) %>% 
  arrange(desc(first_bid - buy_it_now))


# 5) now I assume the condition for distinguish the buy-it-now trades from is below, which classifies 208 trades as BIN trades
trades_BINcondtion <- trades %>% 
  mutate(isBIN = (first_bid == buy_it_now & n_bids == 1))

sum(trades_BINcondtion$isBIN)

# 6) none of the boolean values are related to buy-it-now, since all boolean variables still vary to isBIN
trades_BINcondtion %>% 
  select(isBIN, m_X12, m_X13, m_X14) %>% View

# 7) there could be more than one bids higher than buy-it-now price
camera_named %>%
  group_by(item_id) %>% 
  summarize(count = sum(bid_price > buy_it_now)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(count))

investigate_id(349399376)

# Explanation for the analysis:
#   I would assume the reason that 3) 4) happen because those bidders didn't understand how BIN worked. 
#   Although they could have just used BIN and be better off, they still chose to make an offer equals to or higher than BIN price.
#   However, the problem with this explanation is that the number of people misunderstand the rules (194 + 40), 
#   is more than the number of people used the BIN mechanism correctly (208). This is a very weird result.
